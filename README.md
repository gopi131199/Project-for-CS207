# Project-for-CS207
I am Gurpreet Singh, i'll be making group with Karanbir Singh. We still have to select which project to work on.

We decided to make a project using an ultrasonic sensor. Sensor is mounted on the car. The car will detect the obstacles through ultrasonic sensors and will avoid them.

To get familiar with the repository following is a map of all contents:
  * **/src** - Code for the project
  * **/hardware** - Hardware sketch/ model.
  * **/build** -
  * **/img** - Required images.
  * **/LICENSE** - License file.
  * **/README.md** - About Project that will help you to get started.

**REQUIREMENTS AND MATERIALS**
===============================

Components Needed:
 * Arduino UNO
 * UltraSonic Sensor - HC-SR04
 * Modulo Motor Driver
 * Servo motors
 * Battery
 * Jumper Wires
 * DC Motor
 * Wheels
  
 Libraries that are required:
  Servo.h (inbuilt in Arduino App)
  NewPing.h -: Ultrasonic SEnsor function library (have to install the library, download it from /libraries)
  
**About Our Project(UltraSonic Car):**
======================================

 BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:
